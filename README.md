LAPOP dashboard with fake data based on Shiny R.

This project is designed for LAPOP, a data visualization dashboard for non-professional users.

Due to copyright issues and confidentiality agreements, the dashboard shown uses randomly generated data based on real data formats. Therefore, the data content has no meaning.

**User process:**

1. Select the country and year you want to analyze (multiple choices) to obtain key figures and visualizations of the overall situation of the interviewee.
2. Select the topics and questions you want to analyze in detail, and obtain key numerical and visualization results and time series visualization images for a single problem.
3. Select topics and questions for cross-analysis to get visual results of cross-analysis.
